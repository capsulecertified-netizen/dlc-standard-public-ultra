# Terminology (Ultra‑Abstract)

**Capsule** — A familiar file that also carries essential authorship, origin, and context, alongside lightweight authenticity cues.

**Essential Context** — Minimal information that helps recipients interpret content correctly (e.g., who made it, where it came from).

**Authenticity Cues** — Lightweight signals of provenance intended to be understandable locally by recipients.

**Adoption Levels (Public)** — A simple progression from using Capsules as files, to reading context, to preserving/handing off context, to deeper application features—each step optional.
