**Capsules** are familiar digital files that keep essential truth attached to content so trust can travel with the file. This public abstract states intent and scope only; it deliberately avoids internal details.

## In one sentence
A Capsule is a normal file that carries essential authorship, origin, and minimal context—plus lightweight authenticity cues—so recipients can understand where it came from and what it is, wherever it goes.

## What this is
- A neutral, ecosystem‑friendly explanation of the Capsule concept and its benefits.
- A guide to **incremental adoption** that does not require new infrastructure.

## What this is not
- Not a disclosure of formats, encodings, cryptography, or validation mechanics.
- Not a blockchain, token, NFT, DRM, or surveillance system.

See **/docs** for the ultra‑abstract overview, principles, terminology, and adoption guide.
