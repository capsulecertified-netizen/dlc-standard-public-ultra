# Overview (Ultra‑Abstract)

## The problem
As files move, their story gets lost. People need to know what something is, who made it, and where it came from—without changing how they already work.

## The idea
A **Capsule** is simply a file that keeps essential context attached: authorship, origin, minimal descriptive information, and lightweight authenticity cues that recipients can understand locally.

## The promise
- **Familiar:** Works like a normal file; no new habits.
- **Portable:** Carries essential truth across tools and organizations.
- **Non‑disruptive:** Adoption is optional and incremental.
