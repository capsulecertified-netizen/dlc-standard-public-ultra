# Adoption Guide (Ultra‑Abstract)

Capsules are designed to fit what you already do. You can adopt support in stages:

- **Level 0 — Use as‑is:** Treat a Capsule like any other file. No code needed.
- **Level 1 — Display context:** Read and show authorship/origin/context where helpful.
- **Level 2 — Preserve on handoff:** Keep essential context attached when your system passes the file along; add a simple handoff note if useful.
- **Level 3 — Deeper features:** Offer richer Capsule‑aware behaviors in your product if and when it makes sense.
